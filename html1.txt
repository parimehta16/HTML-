        hello all!
        <h1>Welcome </h1>
        <h2>welcome </h2>
        <h3> welcome </h3>
        <p> How this architecture works: 
            1. The client makes a request to a specific server by sending a message to the server 
            2. The server receives the request and processes it based on its capabilities and available resources. 
            3. Task execution, here the server processes the requested task by retrieving available relevant data. 
            4. Server response, here the server sends a response back to the client and thus confirms that the task was completed. 
        Responses received from the client, the client receives the response from the server and utilises the data retrieved.</p>
        <p> Benefits of client server applications: 
            - It stores the data globally in a centralised repository. That centralised repository may have multiple copies over the internet. If any one copy fails you still get the data/ information from the other copies. 
            - There is a continuous availability of the resources. 
            - The client server application is platform independent. 
            - As long as the different systems with different configurations uses the common protocols set for communication the connectivity will be established properly. 
        Scalability, additional clients can be added without impacting the server performance + upgradations to the server/site can be made as and when required. </p>
